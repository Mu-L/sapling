# Sapling SCM

[Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com/) is a Scalable, User-Friendly Source Control System.

+This extension provides integrations with Sapling, including a webview Interactive Smartlog UI as you would get by running [`sl web`](https://sapling-scm.com/docs/commands/web/):

To launch it, you can either:

- Navigate to View -> Other Windows -> Interactive Smartlog
- Use keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I` on the right panel

More information about this extension can be found [on the Sapling website](https://sapling-scm.com/docs/addons/vs).

**Note: This extension does not include Sapling SCM itself.** You must install Sapling SCM through the [normal installation instructions](https://sapling-scm.com/docs/introduction/installation)
in order for the VS extension to work.
